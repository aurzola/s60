pys60usb - usb connectivity for s60/python

WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA RELEASE - JUST TO SHOW IT'S POSSIBLE

With this you can communicate between phone and pc via the usb cable (Nokia DKU-2).

Currently, only real application is USB console (similar to BT console).

Required software:
- Nokia PC Suite (tested with 6.6.18)
- This can be made to work with Linux, I just don't know the details. 
  Please email me or contact via IRC if you know.
  
PC setup:
- enable USB connectivity on the PC Suite
- when you plugin the phone cable, Control Panel->Phone and Modem Options
  'Modems' tab should have "Nokia XXXX USB modem", connected to some 
  virtual serial port. You can test the connection by starting hyperterminal,
  and typing "AT<enter>". The phone's Fax/Modem process should reply with "OK".
- Leave HyperTerminal open

Phone setup:
- Copy the file symbian\bin\armi\urel to phone system\libs
- Kill FaxModem process (this *might* not be required in all phones). Note, that
  in some phones you might need to do this many times.
- copy python\phone\simpleusbconsole.py to phone and run it
- now you should see familiar text inside the HyperTerminal

Note: When you close down the Python on the phone, it will show Kern-Exec 3. Worry not,
will be fixed in next version.
